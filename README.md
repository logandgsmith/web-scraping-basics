A quick tutorial demonstrating the basics of web scraping for the Open Source Club at UF.

## Get Links Example
Running this script will show all of the links on [https://google.com](https://google.com). However, you can also provide a URL as an argument and the script will display all of the links on that page.

## API Example
This is a trimmed down version of our [Youtube-Stats](https://github.com/ufosc/youtube-stats) project!

To make the api_example.py project work, you must have a config.py file in this directory that contains the following line.

```
api_key = 'YOUR_YT_DATA_API_KEY'
```
